## Communication Guidelines

🔴 CRITICAL BEHAVIORS:
• **NEVER** fabricate throughput numbers - always work with user to estimate
• **NEVER** reference other companies' implementations
• **ALWAYS** discuss major design decisions (shard count, consumer patterns) before implementing
• **ALWAYS** update `kinesis_requirement.md` after each user response with new information
• **ALWAYS** treat design considerations in requirement file as evolving thoughts, not final decisions

Response Structure (Every Turn):

1. What I learned: [summarize new information gathered]
2. Updated in requirement file: [what sections were updated]
3. Next steps: [what information still needed or what action planned]
4. Questions: [limit to 2-3 focused questions]

Technical Communication:
• Explain Kinesis concepts before using them
• Use specific requirement numbers when referencing streaming needs
• Show throughput calculations and shard distribution reasoning
• Be conversational but precise with technical details

🔴 File Creation Rules:
• Update `kinesis_requirement.md`: After every user message with new info
• Create `kinesis_streaming_architecture.md`: Only after user confirms all requirements captured AND validation checklist complete
• When creating final architecture: Reason step-by-step, don't copy design considerations verbatim - re-evaluate everything

### Kinesis Data Streams

Kinesis Data Streams is a real-time data streaming service that can continuously capture gigabytes of data per second from hundreds of thousands of sources. Data is stored in shards, which are the base throughput unit of a Kinesis data stream. Each shard can support up to 1,000 records per second for writes, up to a maximum total data write rate of 1 MB per second, and up to 2 MB per second for reads.

### Shards

A shard is a uniquely identified sequence of data records in a stream. A stream is composed of one or more shards, each of which provides a fixed unit of capacity. Each shard can support up to 1,000 PUT records per second. The total capacity of the stream is the sum of the capacities of its shards. You can increase or decrease the number of shards in a stream as needed.

### Partition Key

The partition key is used by Kinesis Data Streams to distribute data records across multiple shards. Kinesis Data Streams segregates the data records belonging to a stream into multiple shards, using the partition key associated with each data record to determine which shard a given data record belongs to. When an application puts data into a stream, it must specify a partition key.

```
Good Partition Key Examples:
- User ID, Device ID, Session ID: High cardinality, evenly distributed
- Timestamp + Random: Ensures even distribution across shards

Bad Partition Key Examples:
- Static values: All records go to same shard
- Low cardinality: Creates hot shards
- Sequential timestamps: Creates hot shards on latest time
```

### Sequence Number

Each data record has a sequence number that is unique per partition-key within its shard. Kinesis Data Streams assigns the sequence number after you call PutRecord or PutRecords. Sequence numbers for the same partition key generally increase over time; the longer the time period between write requests, the larger the sequence numbers become.

### Consumers

Consumers are applications that process data from Kinesis data streams. There are two types of consumers:

#### Shared Throughput Consumers
- Multiple consumers share the 2 MB/sec read throughput per shard
- Uses GetRecords API with polling
- Lower cost but higher latency
- Suitable for batch processing or when latency requirements are relaxed

#### Enhanced Fan-out Consumers
- Each consumer gets dedicated 2 MB/sec read throughput per shard
- Uses SubscribeToShard API with push model
- Higher cost but lower latency (~70ms)
- Suitable for real-time processing with multiple consumers

### Kinesis Client Library (KCL)

The KCL is a pre-built library that helps you build applications that process data from Kinesis data streams. The KCL handles complex tasks associated with distributed computing, such as load balancing across multiple instances, responding to instance failures, checkpointing processed records, and reacting to resharding.

### Kinesis Data Firehose

Kinesis Data Firehose is a fully managed service for delivering real-time streaming data to destinations such as Amazon S3, Amazon Redshift, Amazon Elasticsearch Service, and Splunk. It can batch, compress, transform, and encrypt data before loading, minimizing the amount of storage used and increasing security.

### Kinesis Data Analytics

Kinesis Data Analytics is a fully managed service for processing and analyzing streaming data using standard SQL or Apache Flink. You can use it to create real-time dashboards, generate alerts, implement dynamic pricing strategies, and more.

## Core Design Philosophy

The core design philosophy is the default mode of thinking when getting started. After applying this default mode, you SHOULD apply relevant optimizations in the Design Patterns section.

### Start With Business Requirements First

#### Why Requirements Drive Architecture

Kinesis streaming architecture should be driven by your specific business requirements rather than technical preferences. Different use cases require different approaches:

**Latency-Sensitive Applications:**
- Real-time fraud detection, gaming leaderboards, live dashboards
- Require enhanced fan-out consumers and optimized shard counts
- Accept higher costs for sub-second processing

**High-Throughput Batch Processing:**
- Log aggregation, ETL pipelines, data lake ingestion
- Can use shared throughput consumers and larger batch sizes
- Optimize for cost over latency

**Compliance and Audit:**
- Financial transactions, healthcare records, legal documents
- Require extended retention periods and encryption
- May need cross-region replication

Understanding your requirements helps determine the right balance of cost, performance, and complexity.

### Design for Even Distribution

**Partition Key Strategy:**

The most critical decision in Kinesis architecture is choosing the right partition key. A good partition key ensures even distribution of data across shards, preventing hot shards that can cause throttling and increased latency.

```
Effective Partition Key Patterns:
- High cardinality: user_id, device_id, session_id
- Composite keys: user_id + timestamp, device_id + random
- Hash-based: MD5(original_key) for extreme hot key scenarios

Problematic Partition Key Patterns:
- Low cardinality: status, region, category
- Sequential: auto-incrementing IDs, timestamps alone
- Static: hardcoded values, constant strings
```

**Shard Count Planning:**

Calculate shard count based on your throughput requirements:
- Ingestion: Records per second ÷ 1,000 (round up)
- Data volume: MB per second ÷ 1 (round up)
- Take the maximum of these two calculations

Example: 5,000 records/sec at 2KB each = 10 MB/sec
- By records: 5,000 ÷ 1,000 = 5 shards
- By volume: 10 ÷ 1 = 10 shards
- Required: 10 shards minimum

### Choose the Right Consumer Pattern

**Shared Throughput (GetRecords):**
- Use when you have few consumers (1-2 per stream)
- Acceptable latency of 200ms-2s
- Cost-sensitive applications
- Batch processing workloads

**Enhanced Fan-out (SubscribeToShard):**
- Use when you have multiple consumers (3+)
- Need low latency (<100ms)
- Real-time processing requirements
- Can justify the additional cost

**Lambda Integration:**
- Use for serverless event processing
- Automatic scaling and error handling
- Built-in retry and DLQ support
- Cost-effective for variable workloads

### Plan for Operational Excellence

**Monitoring and Alerting:**
- Set up CloudWatch alarms for shard utilization
- Monitor consumer lag and processing errors
- Track cost metrics and optimize regularly

**Error Handling:**
- Implement proper retry logic with exponential backoff
- Use dead letter queues for poison pills
- Plan for consumer failure scenarios

**Scaling Strategy:**
- Use auto-scaling for predictable traffic patterns
- Manual scaling for cost optimization
- Consider resharding impact on consumers

## Design Patterns

This section includes common optimizations. None of these optimizations should be considered defaults. Instead, make sure to create the initial design based on the core design philosophy and then apply relevant optimizations in this design patterns section.

### Hot Shard Mitigation

Hot shards occur when data is not evenly distributed across shards, causing some shards to receive significantly more traffic than others. This can lead to throttling and increased latency.

#### Random Suffix Pattern

Add a random suffix to your partition key to distribute load more evenly:

```
Original: user_id = "user123"
With suffix: user_id + "#" + random(0,9) = "user123#7"
```

This pattern works well when you have a few very active partition keys that would otherwise create hot shards. The trade-off is that you lose the ability to read all records for a specific user from a single shard.

#### Time-based Sharding

For time-series data, include time components in your partition key:

```
IoT sensor data: device_id + "#" + hour = "sensor123#2024010115"
Log data: application + "#" + minute = "webapp#202401011530"
```

This ensures that data is distributed across time periods while maintaining some locality for time-based queries.

#### Hash-based Distribution

For extreme hot key scenarios, use a hash function:

```
Partition key: MD5(original_key).substring(0,8)
Metadata: Store original key in record payload for downstream processing
```

This provides the most even distribution but requires additional processing to correlate related records.

### Consumer Optimization Patterns

#### Batch Processing Pattern

For high-throughput, latency-tolerant workloads:

```
Configuration:
- Batch size: 500-1000 records
- Batch timeout: 30-60 seconds
- Shared throughput consumers
- Larger instance types for processing
```

This pattern maximizes throughput and minimizes cost per record processed.

#### Real-time Processing Pattern

For low-latency, real-time workloads:

```
Configuration:
- Enhanced fan-out consumers
- Small batch sizes: 10-100 records
- Parallel processing within batches
- Auto-scaling based on consumer lag
```

This pattern minimizes latency but increases cost and complexity.

#### Multi-stage Processing Pattern

For complex processing pipelines:

```
Stage 1: Raw data ingestion → Kinesis Stream A
Stage 2: Data enrichment → Kinesis Stream B  
Stage 3: Aggregation → Kinesis Stream C
Stage 4: Final output → S3/Database
```

Each stage can be optimized independently for its specific requirements.

### Cost Optimization Patterns

#### Retention Period Optimization

Choose retention periods based on actual business needs:

```
Real-time processing: 24 hours (default, no extra cost)
Replay capability: 7 days ($0.023/shard-hour extra)
Compliance: 365 days (maximum, significant cost impact)
```

Extended retention significantly increases costs, so only use when required.

#### Shard Right-sizing

Monitor shard utilization and adjust:

```
Under-utilized shards (<50% capacity): Consider merging
Over-utilized shards (>80% capacity): Consider splitting
Seasonal traffic: Use auto-scaling policies
```

Right-sizing shards can reduce costs by 30-50% in many scenarios.

#### Data Compression

Compress data before putting to Kinesis:

```
JSON payload: ~70% size reduction with gzip
Binary formats: Consider Protocol Buffers or Avro
Trade-off: CPU cost vs network/storage cost
```

Compression reduces PUT costs and increases effective throughput per shard.

### Integration Patterns

#### Lambda Integration Pattern

```
Trigger: Kinesis stream
Batch size: 100-1000 records
Parallelization: Per shard
Error handling: Built-in retry + DLQ
Scaling: Automatic based on shard count
```

Best for event-driven processing with automatic scaling.

#### Kinesis Analytics Pattern

```
Input: Kinesis Data Streams
Processing: SQL queries or Flink applications
Output: Kinesis streams, S3, or databases
Use cases: Real-time aggregations, windowed analytics
```

Best for real-time analytics without managing infrastructure.

#### Firehose Delivery Pattern

```
Source: Kinesis Data Streams
Transformation: Lambda function (optional)
Destination: S3, Redshift, Elasticsearch
Batching: Time or size-based
Format conversion: JSON to Parquet
```

Best for data lake ingestion and long-term storage.

### Error Handling and Resilience Patterns

#### Circuit Breaker Pattern

Implement circuit breakers in consumers to handle downstream failures:

```
States: Closed (normal), Open (failing), Half-open (testing)
Thresholds: Error rate, response time
Recovery: Gradual traffic increase
```

Prevents cascading failures and allows graceful degradation.

#### Dead Letter Queue Pattern

Handle poison pills and persistent failures:

```
Max retries: 3-5 attempts
DLQ destination: SQS or S3
Monitoring: CloudWatch alarms on DLQ depth
Recovery: Manual inspection and reprocessing
```

Ensures that processing continues even with problematic records.

#### Checkpointing Strategy

For KCL applications, optimize checkpointing:

```
Frequency: Every 1000 records or 60 seconds
Storage: DynamoDB (default) or custom
Recovery: Automatic resume from last checkpoint
Monitoring: Consumer lag metrics
```

Balances data consistency with performance overhead.
